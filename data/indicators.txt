3657	House Republicans passed a revised version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) on Thursday. The bill passed after moderate Republicans fretted this week about how well the bill will protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Many, including former Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton (R-MI), previously came out against the bill, but now support it after GOP leaders agreed to add an amendment adding $8 billion to help cover people with pre-existing conditions. The vote comes after a tumultuous process for the bill, which has seen previously scheduled votes pulled after Speaker Paul Ryan failed to accumulate enough Republican support. Speaker Ryan received widespread criticism after drafting the bill in secret and retaining many parts of Obamacare. Pundits dubbed the original bill, ‚ÄúRyancare.‚Äù	Tone and Language	Right	5
3658	House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) stepped up and brokered a revised version of the bill, known as the MacArthur amendment, along with Tuesday Group co-chairman Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ). The addition of the amendment collected enough Republican votes to pass the bill. Meadows‚Äô efforts in no small part seem to have succeeded where Ryan failed, rallying his House Republican colleagues behind a years-long campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare‚Äìdespite the fact that this bill does not constitute a full repeal of the previous president‚Äôs signature law.	Sources and Citations	Right	8
3659	The American Health Care Act replaces a number of Obamacare‚Äôs taxes and subsidies with age-based tax credits to help people buy health insurance on the individual market. Freedom Caucus members, including Congressman Jim Jordan, previously said that the tax credits would create a new entitlement program. The AHCA repeals Obamacare‚Äôs employer mandate, while it replaces the individual mandate with a 30 percent insurance premium surcharge for those who forgo health insurance. The bill will also cap Medicaid per capita starting in 2020. If the bill passes the House, it will most likely see changes in the Senate. Sens. Bob Portman (R-OH) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) remain concerned about a provision in the American Health Care Act that freezes Medicaid expansion. Senator John Thune (R-SD), the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, has crafted a measure to better compensate older Americans for the high cost of health insurance. Congressman Mark Meadows (R-NC) told Breitbart News that he will work with Senate colleagues to push for a more conservative version.	Coverage and Balance	Right	5
3660	The agreement, brokered by the House Freedom Caucus chairman and Tuesday Group co-chairman Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), would allow states to eliminate Obamacare‚Äôs community rating system ‚Äî a rule that prohibits health insurers from pricing health care plans based on age, gender, or health status. States that repeal Obamacare‚Äôs community rating rules would have to join a high-risk pool to obtain the waiver. The deal, known as the MacArthur amendment, would also reinstate Obamacare‚Äôs Essential Health Benefits, although states could waive these if they were to prove that eliminating those regulations would lower premiums, increase the number of people insured, or ‚Äúadvance another benefit to the public interest in the state.‚Äù Essential Health Benefits require that health insurance plans must cover certain services such as doctors‚Äô services, inpatient or outpatient hospital care, prescription drugs, pregnancy, childbirth, and mental health.	Agenda and Framing	Right	8
3661	Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) were the strongest opponents of the American Health Care Act. Senator Paul crafted his own conservative plan for repealing Obamacare and worked with the Freedom Caucus to push for an even more conservative Obamacare repeal bill. The Freedom Caucus endorsed Sen. Paul‚Äôs plan. Meadows told Breitbart News, ‚ÄúI fully expect that we will repeal most aspects of Obamacare by the end of May. It may have been a deterrent in the first 100 days, but by the end of the first 120 days or so it will be seen as a significant accomplishment. It‚Äôs not how you start, it‚Äôs how you finish, as the as song used to say. We will have an excellent finish.‚Äù	Examples and Analogies	Right	5

14037	Support for the tea party has dropped to an all-time low, said a new CBS News poll released Wednesday. Just 15 percent of Americans told the pollsters that they are supporters of the tea party movement today, which is less than half the level of support at its peak of 31 percent in November 2010 shortly after the midterm election when the movement fueled a landslide Republican win to take majority control of the House. That‚Äôs also the lowest level of support gauged by the poll since it began asking about the tea party in February 2010.	Tone and Language	Center	8
14038	The polls findings were released the day after primary elections in which Republican establishment candidates beat tea party-backed opponents in key races, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell trouncing tea party-backed Matt Bevin in Kentucky. The poll found that the tea party had lost significant support among its core constituency: Republicans. About 32 percent of self-identified Republicans now consider themselves supporters of the tea party, down 10 points from February and a drop of 23 points from July 2010, the summer before the GOP‚Äôs historic midterm win.
